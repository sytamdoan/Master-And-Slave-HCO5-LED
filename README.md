# Master-And-Slave-HCO5-LED
In this project, two HCO5 communicate with eachother. One of the HCO5 is in master command mode and the other is in slave AT command mode.
Both of these HCO5 are connected to seperate arduino, although they do not have to be. The master HCO5 is connected to and gets data from a potentiometer. The value from a potentiometer is then mapped from 1-255 and sent to the slave HCO5. The slave HCO5 takes in this data and displays the value to a connected LED. The brightness of the LED will depend on this value. For more details, feel free to look in the comment of the code.
